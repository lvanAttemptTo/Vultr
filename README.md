# Vultr

## Overview
Vultr is an application for birders. It allows you to get information on birds, find information about an area, view places where a bird has been sighted, and even quiz yourself on the area you are in.

Vultr Uses Two external APIs [ebird](https://ebird.org/home), and  [Flickr](https://flickr.com). The [ebird API key](https://ebird.org/api/keygen) will need to be supplied while the Flicr key is supplied automatically.
